# Turns buttholes inside out
*Jk it auto-sends emails to whatever email address you want, based on chatgpt prompts*

## There's some things you gotta do tho
* Change out the api keys for openai api keys. You can use just 1 if you want. But if you have a few it'll rotate to the next one when you run out of uses
* You'll need to change out the email username and password. Ask chatGpt how to set up your email to be able to send via smtp
* change out the `to` email to whoever you want the emails to go to
